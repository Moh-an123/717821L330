      <h2>Processors</h2>
<p>Just like the human brain, the central processing unit, also known as the CPU, is a computer's control centre, directing all the other components to work together seamlessly. The market offers a diverse range of CPUs, each with its unique merits and demerits.</p>

<h2>RAM</h2>
<p>RAM, also known as random access memory, is a computer’s temporary storage for data. It retains the data that your computer is presently utilizing, including the applications you have running and the documents you are working on. With increased RAM, the computer can store more data in its short-term memory and retrieve it quickly, thus boosting performance.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>While hard disk drive (HDD) and solid-state drive (SSD) are storage devices, their storage media and operational mechanisms differ. Magnetic platters are used in HDDs to store data, whereas flash memory is used in SSDs. This difference in technology directly impacts the overall performance and cost.</p>

<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>Integrated graphics refer to GPUs that are integrated into a motherboard. They aim to support elementary graphical functions for tasks such as video playback, web browsing, and basic office tasks like document editing. Dedicated graphics refer to discrete components that are physically installed in a computer. They are specifically engineered to offer enhanced graphic capabilities for activities like gaming, graphics designing, and video editing.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<p>The display is an indispensable feature of your laptop. Considering that you will be constantly looking at the screen, ensuring it’s of high quality is essential. The screen resolution determines the display quality, represented by the amount of pixels that make up the screen. The greater the resolution, the higher the pixel count, resulting in a more crisp image.</p>

<h2>Battery life</h2>
<p>The battery life of a laptop is the span of time it can function on a single charge. The duration of battery life is quantified in hours. A longer battery lifespan will enable you to use your laptop for extended periods without recharging.</p>

<h2>Other specifications</h2>
<p>The ports and connections are vital specifications to factor in. They serve the purpose of linking peripheral devices to your laptop. Before purchasing, ensure that standard ports and connections such as USB, HDMI, and Ethernet are present.</p>
<p>If you plan on carrying your laptop regularly, weight becomes a significant factor to contemplate. A laptop with less weight is more convenient to transport.</p>
